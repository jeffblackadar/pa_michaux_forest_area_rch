# Run after CloudCompare has created DEMs
# Check the directories exist and are empty. They must be changed manually for each batch of 200
# Check the crs is correct below in two places

"""
This program uses QGIS Process Algorithms. These Process Algorithms are like macros that allow QGIS tasks to be run from Python.
For example a slope tif can be created from the menu Raster | Analysis | Slope
But it can also be run as a process.

## Algorithm ID
Each process has a name.  To see the name of the process, open the Processing Toolbox, locate the process, hover over it with a mouse to see the tooltip.
For example, the Slope process is listed in the Processing Toolbox as GDAL | Raster Analysis | Slope with an Algorithm ID of 'gdal:slope'
The Algorithm ID is needed to run the process result = processing.run("gdal:slope", params)

## Process

### Set crs = EPSG:32129

### Create slope tif
